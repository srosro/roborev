**[Documentation](https://roborev.io)** | **[Quick Start](https://roborev.io/quickstart/)** | **[Installation](https://roborev.io/installation/)**

Continuous code review for AI coding agents. roborev runs in the
background, reviews every commit as agents write code, and surfaces
issues in seconds -- before they compound. Pull code reviews into
your agentic loop while context is fresh.

![roborev TUI](https://roborev.io/assets/generated/tui-hero.svg)

## How It Works

1. Run `roborev init` to install a post-commit hook
2. Every commit triggers a background review -- agents write, roborev reads
3. View findings in the TUI, feed them to your agent, or let `roborev fix` handle it

### Automation, two layers

![How roborev works](https://roborev.io/assets/static/how-it-works.svg)

- **Post-commit reviews** - a git hook reviews every commit in the background (any agent).
- **Agent hook** - watches your Claude Code / Codex session and tells the agent to run the roborev-fix skill when findings pile up.

```bash
roborev init                  # layer 1: per-commit reviews
roborev skills install
roborev agent-hook install    # layer 2: mid-session fix loop (Codex/Claude)
roborev agent-hook install --agent droid  # layer 2: mid-session fix loop (Factory Droid)
```

Before you ship, run the `/roborev-refine` skill: it re-reviews and fixes your
whole branch until every review passes, catching bugs before the PR.

New here? Run `roborev quickstart` and point your agent at it.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd your-repo
roborev init          # Install post-commit hook
git commit -m "..."   # Reviews happen automatically
roborev tui           # View reviews in interactive UI
```

If roborev is managed by a version manager, `roborev init` and
`roborev agent-hook install` try to install hooks with the stable shim/symlink.
You can also choose the exact binary path with
`roborev init --binary ~/.local/share/mise/shims/roborev`,
`roborev agent-hook install --binary ~/.local/share/mise/shims/roborev`, or
`roborev agent-hook install --agent droid --binary ~/.local/share/mise/shims/roborev`.

## Features

- **Background Reviews** - Every commit is reviewed automatically via
  git hooks. No remote review workflow required.
- **Auto-Fix** - `roborev fix` feeds review findings to an agent that
  applies fixes and commits. `roborev refine` iterates until reviews pass.
- **Agent Hook** - Optional Codex, Claude Code, and Factory Droid harness hooks
  can prompt active sessions to run the fix skill when roborev has open failed
  reviews.
- **Code Analysis** - Built-in analysis types (duplication, complexity,
  refactoring, test fixtures, dead code, security) that agents can fix
  automatically.
- **Multi-Agent** - Works with Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, Copilot,
  OpenCode, Cursor, Kiro, Kilo, Droid, and Pi.
- **Runs Locally** - No hosted service or additional infrastructure.
  Reviews are orchestrated on your machine using the coding agents
  you already have configured.
- **Interactive TUI** - Real-time review queue with vim-style navigation.
- **Review Verification** - `roborev compact` verifies findings against
  current code, filters false positives, and consolidates related issues
  into a single review.
- **Extensible Hooks** - Run shell commands on review events. Built-in
  [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) and [kata](https://github.com/kenn-io/kata)
  integrations create trackable issues from review failures automatically.

## The Agentic Fix Loop

When reviews find issues, copy-and-paste the reviews into your
interactive agent sessions, or invoke `/roborev-fix` in Claude Code
or `$roborev-fix` in Codex. You can also address open reviews on the
command line non-interactively with `roborev fix`.

`roborev fix` shows the review findings to an agent, which applies
changes and commits. The new commit gets reviewed automatically,
closing the loop.

For Codex, Claude Code, and Factory Droid sessions, `roborev agent-hook install`
can add an optional harness hook that prompts the active session to invoke
`$roborev-fix` (or `/roborev-fix` for Droid) after configured turn, commit, or
failed-review thresholds are met.
The hook uses a separate local `roborev-agent-hook` daemon for session counters;
it does not run inside the main roborev daemon.

For fully automated iteration (advanced feature), use `refine`:

```bash
roborev refine                  # Fix, re-review, repeat until passing
```

`refine` runs in an isolated worktree and loops: fix findings, wait for
re-review, fix again, until all reviews pass or `--max-iterations` is hit.

## Code Analysis

Run targeted analysis across your codebase and optionally auto-fix:

```bash
roborev analyze duplication ./...           # Find duplication
roborev analyze refactor --fix *.go         # Suggest and apply refactors
roborev analyze complexity --wait main.go   # Analyze and show results
roborev analyze test-fixtures *_test.go     # Find test helper opportunities
roborev analyze security ./...              # Find security risks in existing code
```

Available types: `test-fixtures`, `duplication`, `refactor`, `complexity`,
`api-design`, `dead-code`, `architecture`, `security`.

Analysis jobs appear in the review queue. Use `roborev fix` to apply
open findings later, target a specific job with `roborev fix <id>`, or
pass `--fix` to apply immediately.

Analysis types can pin their own agent settings in config:

```toml
[analyze.refactor]
agent = "claude-code"
model = "sonnet"
reasoning = "fast"
```

## Installation

**Shell Script (macOS / Linux):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://roborev.io/install.sh | bash
```

**Homebrew (macOS / Linux):**
```bash
brew install roborev-dev/tap/roborev
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://roborev.io/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**With Go:**
```bash
go install go.kenn.io/roborev/cmd/roborev@latest
```

## Developer Setup

This repo uses [`prek`](https://prek.j178.dev/) for local pre-commit checks.
The hooks are local system hooks. They run a fast Git-test isolation guard,
`make lint-ci` for non-mutating Go lint, and `make markdown-ci` for non-mutating
Zensical Markdown formatting checks. These hooks use `always_run = true`, so
they run on every commit. The Renovate config validator runs when
`renovate.json` changes.

```bash
brew install prek uv  # or use your preferred install method
mise use --global npm:renovate@latest
prek install          # install the local git hook
prek run --all-files  # run the configured checks manually
```

Use `make lint` when you explicitly want golangci-lint to apply fixes. Use
`make markdown` to wrap prose in published Zensical pages at 80 columns while
leaving Markdown tables unchanged. Use `make check-renovate-config` to validate
`renovate.json` directly.

### Exporting review history

Use `roborev export reviews` to emit completed reviews as one JSON document for
local reporting or archival workflows:

```bash
roborev export reviews
roborev export reviews --profile metadata --since 2026-06-01 --until 2026-06-30
roborev export reviews --closed-only --repo github.com/org/repo --limit 1000
roborev export reviews --cursor "$NEXT_CURSOR" --until 2026-07-01
```

The default `content` profile includes raw review output as stored. That output
may contain sensitive repository details, so handle exported files carefully.
Use `--profile metadata` when you only need identifiers, timestamps, verdicts,
cost metadata, and related review metadata.

Exports include a stable `database_id` for the local review database and, when
at least one review is emitted, an opaque `next_cursor`. Pass
`--cursor <next_cursor>` to resume after the previous page; `--cursor` cannot
be combined with `--since`. If a cursor belongs to a previous database
generation, `roborev export reviews` exits with code `3`; discard the cursor
and retry with a window backfill. Other cursor rejections also require
discarding the cursor before backfilling.

Use `roborev export ci-metrics` to emit finalized CI panel runs — terminal
outcome (`review_posted`, `no_review_posted`, `giveup_posted`, `abandoned`,
or `unknown` for panels finalized before outcomes were recorded),
first-attempt and posting timestamps, attempt count, and each panel's
member/synthesis jobs — for external review turnaround tracking. It follows
the same cursor contract as `roborev export reviews`, ordered by
`posted_at`, and exits with code `3` when a cursor's `database_id` no
longer matches so callers can discard the cursor and backfill.

Pass `--legacy` to export the frozen pre-panel CI era instead (rows with
outcome `legacy_review`, one per reviewed PR head, from before panel runs
existed) as a one-time backfill; legacy and panel cursors are namespaced
and cannot be resumed against each other's export.

## Configuration

Create `.roborev.toml` in your repo:

```toml
agent = "claude-code"
snapshot_dir = ".roborev"
review_guidelines = """
Project-specific review instructions here.
"""
# Optional: use repo guidelines instead of appending global review_guidelines.
review_guidelines_supersede_global = false
# Optional: disable the REVIEW.md fallback explicitly.
review_md_fallback = true

# Optional: metadata for roborev-owned fix commits and prompt hints for agent-owned fix commits.
fix_commit_author = "Your Name <you@example.com>"
fix_commit_co_authored_by = ["Pair Reviewer <pair@example.com>"]
```

You can also set `review_guidelines` in `~/.roborev/config.toml`. Global
guidelines apply to every repo and are appended before repo guidelines by
default.

If `review_guidelines` is unset or empty, roborev falls back to a `REVIEW.md`
file at the repo root — the same file Claude Code's Code Review auto-discovers,
so one committed file can drive both reviewers. Set `review_md_fallback = false`
to opt out explicitly. Like `.roborev.toml`, `REVIEW.md` is read from the default
branch when one resolves, and from the working tree when it does not.

`snapshot_dir` must be repo-relative. `roborev init` ensures it is ignored in `.gitignore`; snapshot creation also adds a local `.git/info/exclude` fallback for existing checkouts whose ignore setup is stale.

See [configuration guide](https://roborev.io/configuration/) for all options.

### Kata task context

If your repo is bound to a [kata](https://github.com/kenn-io/kata) project (a
committed `.kata.toml`), roborev can pull the kata issue(s) referenced in the
reviewed commit messages into the review prompt, and file review findings back
as kata issues.

```toml
# .roborev.toml
[kata_context]
mode = "current"   # off (default) | current | open
max_chars = 50000  # cap on kata context bytes in the prompt

# File a kata issue when a review fails or returns findings:
[[hooks]]
event = "review.*"
type = "kata"
# branches = ["main"]        # only file katas for reviews on these branches; default all
# project  = "myproj"        # defaults to the .kata.toml binding
# labels   = ["from-review"]
# priority = 2
```

`mode = "current"` includes only the katas referenced anywhere in the reviewed
commit messages (e.g. `Closes: kata#abc4`); `open` includes every open kata in
the bound project, except issues the kata hook itself filed (labelled
`roborev`), so review findings are not fed back into later reviews as task
intent. A hook's optional `branches` list (glob patterns such as `release/*`)
limits it to reviews on matching branches; unset fires on all branches. The
matched branch is the commit's branch for local reviews and the PR base
(target) branch for CI pull-request reviews — so `branches = ["main"]` means
commits on `main` locally but PRs *targeting* `main` in CI, and a fork's head
branch name cannot satisfy a protected-branch filter. The `kata` CLI must be
on `PATH`; when it is absent or the repo is unbound, prompt context is
silently skipped. Any other failure — a broken `.kata.toml`, a failing `kata`
invocation — is logged by both the prompt builder and the configured `kata`
hook, so a configured integration never goes dark unnoticed.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ROBOREV_DATA_DIR` | Override default data directory (`~/.roborev`) |
| `ROBOREV_COLOR_MODE` | TUI color theme: `auto` (default), `dark`, `light`, `none` |
| `ROBOREV_SYNC_CURSOR_LOOKBACK` | PostgreSQL sync cursor overlap duration (default `5m`) |
| `ROBOREV_AGENT_HOOK_TURN_THRESHOLD` | Override agent-hook Stop threshold |
| `ROBOREV_AGENT_HOOK_COMMIT_THRESHOLD` | Override agent-hook commit threshold |
| `ROBOREV_AGENT_HOOK_FAILED_REVIEW_THRESHOLD` | Override agent-hook failed-review threshold |
| `ROBOREV_DROID_HOOK_TURN_THRESHOLD` | Override Factory Droid agent-hook Stop threshold |
| `ROBOREV_DROID_HOOK_COMMIT_THRESHOLD` | Override Factory Droid agent-hook commit threshold |
| `ROBOREV_DROID_HOOK_FAILED_REVIEW_THRESHOLD` | Override Factory Droid agent-hook failed-review threshold |
| `NO_COLOR` | Set to any value to disable all color output ([no-color.org](https://no-color.org)) |

## Supported Agents

| Agent | Install |
|-------|---------|
| Codex | `npm install -g @openai/codex` |
| Claude Code | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| Gemini | `curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh \| bash` (preferred Antigravity CLI) or `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` |
| Copilot | `npm install -g @github/copilot` |
| OpenCode | `npm install -g opencode-ai@latest` ([anomalyco/opencode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode)) |
| Cursor | [cursor.com](https://www.cursor.com/) |
| Kiro | [kiro.dev](https://kiro.dev/) |
| Kilo | `npm install -g @kilocode/cli` |
| Droid | [factory.ai](https://factory.ai/) |
| Pi | [pi.dev](https://pi.dev/) |

roborev auto-detects installed agents.

To use Pi as the auto-design routing classifier (`classify_agent = "pi"`),
install the JSON Schema output extension too:

```bash
pi install npm:@nqbao/pi-json-schema
```

roborev loads this extension explicitly when it invokes the classifier. Keeping
it installed in Pi makes the classifier setup visible in `pi list` and avoids
runtime package-fetch surprises in offline or locked-down environments.

### Routing Claude Code to a proxy (Ollama, LiteLLM, etc.)

The `claude-code` agent accepts a model spec of the form `<model>@<base_url>`.
When `<base_url>` starts with `http(s)://`, roborev points Claude Code at
that endpoint and pins all tier aliases (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku/subagent) to the
given model.

```toml
# .roborev.toml — local Ollama for reviews, real Anthropic for fixes
agent = "claude-code"
review_model = "glm-5.1:cloud@http://127.0.0.1:11434"
fix_model    = "sonnet"
```

Or via CLI: `roborev review --model 'glm-5.1:cloud@http://127.0.0.1:11434'`.

**Proxy auth.** Set `ROBOREV_CLAUDE_PROXY_TOKEN` to forward a bearer token
to the proxy as `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`. If unset, roborev sends a placeholder
(sufficient for gateways that don't check the header, such as Ollama).
roborev does *not* forward `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to proxy endpoints — that
would leak a real Anthropic credential to arbitrary third parties.

**URL restrictions.** Proxy URLs must not embed `user:pass@` credentials
(use `ROBOREV_CLAUDE_PROXY_TOKEN`); `http://` is only accepted for loopback
hosts (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`) so plaintext endpoints can't receive
tokens over the wire. Use `https://` for remote proxies. The full URL
(including any path or query string) is forwarded as-is to
`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, so include the path your gateway expects (e.g.
LiteLLM may want a trailing `/v1`; Ollama wants no path).

**Environment behavior (breaking change in this release).** When the
`claude-code` agent runs, roborev always strips inherited `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`,
`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_{OPUS,SONNET,HAIKU}_MODEL`, and `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`
from the child environment. If you were previously routing Claude Code by
exporting these vars in your shell, switch to the `<model>@<base_url>` spec
instead. For native (non-proxy) mode, configure `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` via
roborev's config (it is re-injected from roborev's stored key, not inherited
from the operator's shell).

## Telemetry

roborev sends limited anonymous telemetry to PostHog when the daemon starts
and once every 24 hours while the daemon remains running: `daemon_started`
and `daemon_active` with repo count, review count, sync enabled, CI
enabled, and auto-design enabled, plus `application=roborev`, version, OS/arch,
`$process_person_profile=false`, `$geoip_disable=true`, and an anonymous install
ID.
It does not send repo names, paths, remotes, prompts, review output, provider
tokens, usernames, or IP geolocation. Set `ROBOREV_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0` to
disable it. `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0` is also honored. Telemetry is always disabled
inside Go test processes, regardless of environment variables.

## Security Model

roborev delegates code review and fix tasks to AI coding agents that
have shell access. Review agents may execute read-only git and shell
commands to inspect diffs; fix agents run in isolated worktrees with
full tool access.

**roborev is designed for use with trusted codebases.** The review
prompt includes diff content and commit messages from the repository.
If you are reviewing untrusted code (e.g., open-source contributions
from unknown authors), run roborev inside a sandboxed environment
(container, VM, or similar) to limit the blast radius of any
prompt-injection attack that could cause an agent to execute
unintended commands.
